    <p>[American, 1997-]
    Megan Tiller is an artist and designer from the Northern Virginia DMV area with a passion for storytelling. In 2022, she graduated from Harford Community College with an AFA in Graphic Design.
    As an avid, lifelong reader, she is heavily influenced by children's book illustrators such as AG Ford, and Shanda McCloskey, and Pixar movies. Her love of drawing, the moving image, and stories, evolved into an enthusiasm for book cover design and graphic design for movies and television. She also enjoys projects that allow her to work in either a traditional, or multimedia based approach.
    Along with striving to be the most creative she can be in her design work, in her free time she also enjoys writing both her own stories and music. </p>
